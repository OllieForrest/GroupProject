# Description of Purpose, Design and Use
# This application requires players to guess the price of an item sold by another. Players can register, edit and view their accounts and account details. Points are awarded on the basis of guess accuracy, and those points are then accumulated. When a post is made, the price paid, condition, description and name is displayed to the player, and the price the item was sold for is hidden. Based on the information provided, players must guess the price the item was sold for. The leaderboard displays the players with the most points.
